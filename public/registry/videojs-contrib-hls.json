video.js HLS Tech\n\nA video.js tech that plays HLS video on platforms that don't support it but have Flash.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/videojs/videojs-contrib-hls.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/videojs/videojs-contrib-hls)\n\n## Getting Started\nDownload the [Media Source plugin](https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-media-sources/releases) as well as the [HLS tech](https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-hls/releases). On your web page:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"video.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"videojs-media-sources.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"videojs-hls.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  var player = videojs('test-vid');\n  player.play();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Documentation\n[HTTP Live Streaming](https://developer.apple.com/streaming/) (HLS) has\nbecome a de-facto standard for streaming video on mobile devices\nthanks to its native support on iOS and Android. There are a number of\nreasons independent of platform to recommend the format, though:\n\n- Supports (client-driven) adaptive bitrate selection\n- Delivered over standard HTTP ports\n- Simple, text-based manifest format\n- No proprietary streaming servers required\n\nUnfortunately, all the major desktop browsers except for Safari are\nmissing HLS support. That leaves web developers in the unfortunate\nposition of having to maintain alternate renditions of the same video\nand potentially having to forego HTML-based video entirely to provide\nthe best desktop viewing experience.\n\nThis tech attempts to address that situation by providing a polyfill\nfor HLS on browsers that have Flash support. You can deploy a single\nHLS stream, code against the regular HTML5 video APIs, and create a\nfast, high-quality video experience across all the big web device\ncategories.\n\nCheck out the [full documentation](docs/) for details on how HLS works\nand advanced configuration. A description of the [adaptive switching\nbehavior](docs/bitrate-switching.md) is available, too.\n\nThe videojs-hls tech is still working towards a 1.0 release so it\nmay not fit your requirements today. Specifically, there is _no_\nsupport for:\n\n- Alternate audio and video tracks\n- Subtitles\n- Segment codecs _other than_ H.264 with AAC audio\n- Internet Explorer < 10\n\n### Options\n\nYou may pass in an options object to the hls tech at player\ninitialization. You can pass in options just like you would for any\nother tech:\n\n```javascript\nvideojs(video, {\n  hls: {\n    withCredentials: true\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### withCredentials\nType: `boolean`\n\nWhen the `withCredentials` property is set to `true`, all XHR requests for\nmanifests and segments would have `withCredentials` set to `true` as well. This\nenables storing and passing cookies from the server that the manifests and\nsegments live on. This has some implications on CORS because when set, the\n`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header cannot be set to `*`, also, the response\nheaders require the addition of `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header which\nis set to `true`.\nSee html5rocks's [article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/)\nfor more info.\n\n### Runtime Properties\n#### player.hls.playlists.master\nType: `object`\n\nAn object representing the parsed master playlist. If a media playlist\nis loaded directly, a master playlist with only one entry will be\ncreated.\n\n#### player.hls.playlists.media\nType: `function`\n\nA function that can be used to retrieve or modify the currently active\nmedia playlist. The active media playlist is referred to when\nadditional video data needs to be downloaded. Calling this function\nwith no arguments returns the parsed playlist object for the active\nmedia playlist. Calling this function with a playlist object from the\nmaster playlist or a URI string as specified in the master playlist\nwill kick off an asynchronous load of the specified media\nplaylist. Once it has been retreived, it will become the active media\nplaylist.\n\n#### player.hls.mediaIndex\nType: `number`\n\nThe index of the next video segment to be downloaded from\n`player.hls.media`.\n\n#### player.hls.segmentXhrTime\nType: `number`\n\nThe number of milliseconds it took to download the last media segment.\nThis value is updated after each segment download completes.\n\n#### player.hls.bandwidth\nType: `number`\n\nThe number of bits downloaded per second in the last segment download.\nThis value is used by the default implementation of `selectPlaylist`\nto select an appropriate bitrate to play.\n\nBefore the first video segment has been downloaded, it's hard to\nestimate bandwidth accurately. The HLS tech uses a heuristic based on\nthe playlist download times to do this estimation by default. If you\nhave a more accurate source of bandwidth information, you can override\nthis value as soon as the HLS tech has loaded to provide an initial\nbandwidth estimate.\n\n#### player.hls.bytesReceived\nType: `number`\n\nThe total number of content bytes downloaded by the HLS tech.\n\n#### player.hls.selectPlaylist\nType: `function`\n\nA function that returns the media playlist object to use to download\nthe next segment. It is invoked by the tech immediately before a new\nsegment is downloaded. You can override this function to provide your\nadaptive streaming logic. You must, however, be sure to return a valid\nmedia playlist object that is present in `player.hls.master`.\n\n### Events\n#### loadedmetadata\n\nFired after the first media playlist is downloaded for a stream.\n\n#### loadedplaylist\n\nFired immediately after a new master or media playlist has been\ndownloaded. By default, the tech only downloads playlists as they\nare needed.\n\n#### mediachange\n\nFired when a new playlist becomes the active media playlist. Note that\nthe actual rendering quality change does not occur simultaneously with\nthis event; a new segment must be requested and the existing buffer\ndepleted first.\n\n### In-Band Metadata\nThe HLS tech supports [timed\nmetadata](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/HTTP_Live_Streaming_Metadata_Spec/Introduction/Introduction.html)\nembedded as [ID3 tags](http://id3.org/id3v2.3.0). When a stream is\nencountered with embedded metadata, an [in-band metadata text\ntrack](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#text-track-in-band-metadata-track-dispatch-type)\nwill automatically be created and populated with cues as they are\nencountered in the stream. Only UTF-8 encoded\n[TXXX](http://id3.org/id3v2.3.0#User_defined_text_information_frame)\nand [WXXX](http://id3.org/id3v2.3.0#User_defined_URL_link_frame) ID3\nframes are currently mapped to cue points. There are lots of guides\nand references to using text tracks [around the\nweb](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/track/basics/).\n\n### Testing\n\nFor testing, you can either run `npm test` or use `grunt` directly.\nIf you use `npm test`, it will only run the karma tests using chrome.\nYou can specify which browsers you want the tests to run via grunt's `test` task.\nYou can use either grunt-style arguments or comma separated arguments:\n```\ngrunt test:chrome:firefox\t# grunt-style\ngrunt test:chrome,firefox\t# comma-separated\n```\nPossible options are:\n* `chromecanary`\n* `phantomjs`\n* `opera`\n* `chrome`\n* `safari`\n* `firefox`\n* `ie`\n\n## Hosting Considerations\nUnlike a native HLS implementation, the HLS tech has to comply with\nthe browser's security policies. That means that all the files that\nmake up the stream must be served from the same domain as the page\nhosting the video player or from a server that has appropriate [CORS\nheaders](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS)\nconfigured. Easy [instructions are\navailable](http://enable-cors.org/server.html) for popular webservers\nand most CDNs should have no trouble turning CORS on for your account.\n\n## Release History\n- 0.13.0:\n  - Improved audio/video synchronization\n  - Fixes for live, HLSe, and discontinuities\n  - Rename internal methods to clarify their intended visibility\n- 0.12.0: support for custom IVs with AES-128 encryption\n- 0.11.0: embedded ID3 tags are exposed as an in-band metadata track\n- 0.10.0: optimistic initial bitrate selection\n- 0.9.0: support segment level AES-128 encryption\n- 0.8.0: support for EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY\n- 0.7.0: convert the HLS plugin to a tech\n- 0.6.0:\n  - Refactor playlist loading\n  - Add testing via karma\n- 0.5.0: cookie-based content protection support (see `withCredentials`)\n- 0.4.0: Live stream support\n- 0.3.0: Performance fixes for high-bitrate streams\n- 0.2.0: Basic playback and adaptive bitrate selection\n- 0.1.0: Initial release\n","maintainers":[{"name":"dmlap","email":"dlapalomento@gmail.com"},{"name":"gkatsev","email":"me@gkatsev.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-04-28T22:10:26.719Z","created":"2014-04-11T22:28:32.355Z","0.4.0":"2014-04-11T22:28:32.355Z","0.4.1":"2014-04-14T21:10:08.474Z","0.5.0":"2014-04-18T15:00:29.624Z","0.6.0":"2014-05-16T19:00:42.402Z","0.7.0":"2014-05-30T15:58:05.491Z","0.7.1":"2014-06-05T16:51:40.300Z","0.7.2":"2014-06-13T16:10:30.138Z","0.8.0":"2014-06-26T17:56:30.403Z","0.8.1":"2014-07-02T19:30:13.980Z","0.8.2":"2014-07-09T17:23:23.340Z","0.8.3":"2014-07-25T15:37:19.103Z","0.8.4":"2014-08-15T19:34:53.355Z","0.9.0":"2014-09-09T13:49:33.023Z","0.9.1":"2014-09-29T20:28:08.751Z","0.9.2":"2014-10-10T16:00:13.816Z","0.10.0":"2014-10-31T14:18:05.863Z","0.10.1":"2014-11-25T22:36:01.876Z","0.10.2":"2015-01-06T19:54:31.001Z","0.10.3":"2015-01-07T22:03:00.685Z","0.10.4":"2015-02-09T18:42:04.793Z","0.11.0":"2015-03-02T23:02:56.436Z","0.11.1":"2015-03-11T21:31:44.454Z","0.11.2":"2015-03-20T18:55:50.510Z","0.12.0":"2015-04-02T21:17:37.146Z","0.13.0":"2015-04-16T20:32:57.125Z","0.13.1":"2015-04-28T22:10:26.719Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-hls","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git@github.com:videojs/videojs-contrib-hls.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-hls/issues"},"license":"Apache 2","readmeFilename":"README.md","keywords":["videojs","videojs-plugin"]}
