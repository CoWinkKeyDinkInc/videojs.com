# Harp + Grunt + Browserify boilerplate

I found myself setting this up manually the first few times, so I decided to go ahead and make things official with a little
boilerplate repo. There's nothing fancy here, simply a Grunt file that includes tasks for running a [Harp](http://harpjs.com)
project along with [Browserify](http://browserify.com).

### Usage

1. Install the dependencies

  ```
  $ npm install
  ```

2. Kick the grunt dev task

  ```
  $ grunt dev
  ```

Once `grunt dev` is running, you can start working. A local preview is running on port 9000.

### Structure

```
- public
  - css
    - components
      - _base.scss
      - ...
    - modules
      - _colors.scss
      - _utility.scss
    - main.scss
  - js
    - bundle.js*
  - _layout.ejs
  - index.ejs
- src-js
  - app.js
```

**\*Note**: the `bundle.js` file generated by Browserify (and placed in `public/js`) is gitignored.
